title: "Keyboard Backlighting: Why?"
issue_id: 2
---

The [brouhaha][bru] over [Apple's][aap] latest [MacBook Pro][mbp] seems to be
louder and more sustained than the typical backlash to a new Apple product.
The common theme is a sense of disappointment that the long-awaited new
top-of-the-line "developer" machine does not meet expectations. While I've
never owned a MacBook, I figure it's the perfect time to share my seemingly
unique gripe: keyboard backlighting makes no sense.

### No one needs a backlit keyboard

Let us assume that there is a person and their laptop. Now, please, friend, let
us enumerate all possibilities in which light-up keys on said laptop could play
a factor:

1. The person is capable of [touch typing][tch]. **The person does not need to
look at the keyboard.**
2. The person looks at the keyboard while operating the laptop.
    1. A light source is illuminating the laptop. **The person can see the
    keyboard without backlighting.**
    2. The person and laptop are in darkness.
        1. The laptop's screen is on. **The screen illuminates the keyboard,
        and thus the person can see the keyboard without backlighting.**
        2. The laptop's screen is off. **Keyboard backlighting cannot aid in
        the operation of the laptop while the screen is off.**

So we see that there is no situation in which keyboard backlighting serves a
vital function.

### Downsides

Battery life
Extra hardware

### If an Apple jumps off a bridge...

Can't avoid
Self-delusion
