title: "My Dream Laptop: The Anti-MacBook"
issue_id: 2
---

The [brouhaha][bru] over [Apple's][aap] latest [MacBook Pro][mbp] seems to be
louder and more sustained than the typical backlash to a new Apple product.
The common theme is a sense of disappointment that the long-awaited new
top-of-the-line "developer" machine does not meet expectations. With that in
mind, I figure it's the perfect time to share my terrible secret: I never liked
the MacBook.

### Terrible secret

I don't like the design of the MacBook at all. I think Apple has made the wrong
choice in almost every aspect. What's worse, Apple's premium status and absurd
financial success have led [almost][sam] every [other][hpc] laptop
[manufacturer][asu] to copy Apple as much as possible, making it
near-impossible to find a truly sensible laptop.

Let me be clear: I know that this sentiment is practically blasphemous among
hip, trendy [software developers][dev] and hip, trendy [college students][col].
But I feel that there must be a voice of dissent.

What I want in a laptop is for [form to follow function][fun]. A laptop is a
computer, after all, albeit one in which most aspects (power, configurability,
price, etc.) suffer in exchange for portability. If you ever want to feel bad
about how much money you spent on a laptop, head on over to
[https://pcpartpicker.com/][pcp] and see how much less you would pay for a
desktop with similar specs... or how much more you could get for the same
amount of money.

Given that the value of a laptop is its portability, the single most important
factor is weight. Hang on, I already know what you're thinking: "But MacBooks
are light!" Yes and no.
