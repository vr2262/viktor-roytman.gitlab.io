title: Comments? GitHub Issues
issue_id: 5
---

As I mentioned in my [first post][fst], rather than have a typical comments
section at the bottom of each post, I've decided to use the issues of [this
site's GitHub repository][rpo] for comments. Time will tell if this is a
sensible thing to do, but for now I'll go through my reasoning.

### Comments are awful

It practically goes without saying, but online comments are bad. Look at any
article, Facebook post, tweet, YouTube video --- you name it --- that has
attracted any sort of attention. There have been some [half-baked
attempts][hba] to improve online comments by requiring people to use their real
names, but by now I hope it has become abundantly clear that it's not a good
idea.

People say [don't read the comments][drc], but I have a morbid curiosity about
them. I can't look away; I want to know what fresh and creative ways people
have devised to be horrible.

So the answer is not to have comments at all, right? [If it works for
NPR][npr] (and quite a few notable bloggers), shouldn't it work for me? I'm not
so sure. Whenever I see a post without a comments section, I feel its absence.
Don't get me wrong; I'm not criticizing anyone who chooses not to let the
unfiltered thoughts of strangers take residence on their personal site. Also,
like in so many other things, marginalized groups face the worst of it ---
[women][whs], [people of color][poc], [queer people][qhs].

Still, this is the Internet, the greatest tool we have to inform and connect
people around the world. Can't we do something to foster productive discussion
rather than hate and bile?
