title: Choosing a License

I have decided to license this site as [CC BY-SA 4.0][lic]. Here was my thought
process.

### What Would [Stallman][rms] Do?

I've never chosen a license for a non-software creative work before. The go-to
resource for free software licensing is the [Free Software Foundation][fsf].
What license do they use for their site? [CC BY-ND 4.0][cnd]. This license does
not allow derivative works, which means that the FSF [does not consider it a
free license][fnd]. So what gives?

You can find their reasoning [here][rsn]. The relevant excerpt:

>Works that express someone's opinion—memoirs, editorials, and so on—serve a
>fundamentally different purpose than works for practical use like software and
>documentation. Because of this, we expect them to provide recipients with a
>different set of permissions: just the permission to copy and distribute the
>work verbatim. [Richard Stallman discusses this][rnd] frequently in his
>speeches.

I can understand that, but it still doesn't seem right to license this site in
such a way. A nonfree license is a tool of discouragement, and I want to
encourage people to view and use my work and thoughts.

Let's see [what the FSF has to say][fsa] about CC BY-SA 4.0.

>This is a copyleft free license that is good for artistic and entertainment
>works, and educational works.

[Copyleft][cpl] is good; modified versions of open works should be open. Is my
work educational? Sure, let's go with that.
